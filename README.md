These scripts have been tested on Ubuntu 20.04. Aside from `setup.sh` they likely work out-of-the-box on any Linux distro that you can adapt 
`setup.sh` to run on.

You will need credentials for AWS and wireguard keys for the server. They need to be stored in a filed called `decrypted_credentials` stored in the directory the scripts are run from.

```
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=...
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=...
export AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=...

export server_private_key=...
export server_public_key=...
```
You will need the AWS `pem` key to access your Lighthouse instance. It needs to be named `wg_rsa` and stored in the directory the scripts are run from.
